# SVG Trial Review Notes

## Trial identity

- Asset type: `native_object`
- Lane: `native_vector_elements`
- Concept: `modular-ribbon`
- Execution: local native SVG builder
- Remote provider/GPU/Kaggle: not called
- Source execution id: `91f5b18c-543d-4b01-9cc5-6632c4bc1087`
- Source artifact id: `369f2852-27a1-4cac-9089-cdfb33847816`

## Technical result

The SVG passed the local native-vector gate with a 2048x2048 artboard, 13 SVG elements, no raster embed, no text, no script, and a transparent canvas. The local build returned `review_ready` and produced a release package in the temporary trial project. The durable SVG copy is stored beside this note.

## Visual review observation

A full-artboard browser preview was captured after fitting the SVG to the viewport. The asset is a single centered abstract ribbon-like form with two orange modular squares and one pale module on a transparent canvas. The shape is readable and editable, but the pale module has low contrast against a white browser preview and the overall object occupies the upper-left portion of the fitted screenshot because the artboard has substantial empty space. These are human visual/commercial review observations, not automatic marketplace rejection findings.

## Decision status

Technical status: PASS.

Commercial status: REVIEW_REQUIRED. The asset should not be marked upload-ready solely from the structural pass. A human should decide whether the silhouette is sufficiently distinctive, whether the pale module remains useful on intended backgrounds, and whether the large empty artboard is commercially appropriate.

## User feedback — 2026-08-24

The user rated the result **2/10** on a ten-point scale and rejected it for further use. The user reported that the buyer would be confused about what the image represents and what it should be used for. The user requested that this result be retained for evaluation and discussion before any new change or trial.

This feedback is recorded as an exact overall human rating. The structured four-field `portfolio evaluate` record is intentionally not written yet because the user did not provide separate visual, technical, buyer-fit, and metadata scores. The result must not be marked upload-ready.

## Internal visual audit after user rejection — 2026-08-24

The preview reads as an abstract bent loop or strap with two orange square modules and a pale central module. It does not communicate a specific buyer job, category, use case, or action without an accompanying explanation. The centered subject is absent: the artwork occupies only the upper-left portion of the large square artboard, leaving excessive unused white space. The pale module has weak separation from the white background. These are commercial/communication failures, not structural SVG failures. No remediation has been applied because the user requested discussion before changes.
